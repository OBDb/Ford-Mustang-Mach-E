    description: "The Ford Mustang Mach-E is the brand's first purpose-built electric vehicle, controversially extending the Mustang nameplate to a four-door crossover SUV. Built on a dedicated EV platform, it features distinctive styling that incorporates Mustang design cues including tri-bar taillights, a long hood proportion, and aggressive headlights, while adapting them to a crossover silhouette. Available with standard or extended-range battery options (approximately 70 kWh and 91 kWh usable capacity), and in rear-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations, the lineup spans from the entry-level Select to the performance-oriented GT, with various trims including Premium and California Route 1 in between. Power outputs range from 266 HP in the base RWD model to 480 HP in the GT Performance Edition, with the latter capable of 0-60 mph acceleration in 3.5 seconds. Range varies by configuration, reaching up to 312 miles EPA-estimated in the most efficient variants. The interior showcases Ford's next-generation technology, featuring a minimalist dashboard dominated by a 15.5-inch vertical touchscreen running SYNC 4A with over-the-air update capability, and a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster. A notable innovation is the absence of traditional door handles, replaced by electronic buttons with small emergency pull handles, and a phone-as-key feature. Charging capabilities include support for up to 150 kW DC fast charging, allowing a 10-80% charge in approximately 45 minutes. The Mach-E features Ford's BlueCruise hands-free driving system on equipped highways, and a comprehensive suite of driver assistance technologies. Since its introduction, Ford has made continuous improvements through over-the-air updates and yearly model changes, enhancing charging speeds, range, and performance while adding features. The Mach-E represents Ford's strategy to leverage its iconic nameplate while transitioning to an electric future, offering a balance of performance, practicality, and technology that competes directly with vehicles like the Tesla Model Y."
